This is an important part of coding: nobody has everything memorised, but we are all experts at Googling the information we need quickly. Search around, read pandas docs, stack overflow, medium, and anywhere else you find information. If you're totally stuck feel free to ask your \"colleagues\" (fellow students), your instructor, or one of our junior instructors. Most of the time though, we'll have taught you the answer in one of the previous notebooks, please check back in them too, they will be a great source of information throughout this

Regular expressions are sequences of characters designed to match patterns. They can become really complex (to match complex patterns), but for this case, a simple [5 minute tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQQsYXa1EHs&ab_channel=Kite) or some google should be enough. Whenever you see people writing regex in plain python, remember that you can use any regular expression directly inside of a Pandas `str` method.
