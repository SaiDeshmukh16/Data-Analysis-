This is an important part of coding: nobody has everything memorised, but we are all experts at Googling the information we need quickly.\n"," \n","In this notebook we've included a couple of challenges that require methods we haven't taught you - this is a purposeful move to start your path to Google glory. Search around, read pandas docs, stack overflow, medium, and anywhere else you find information. \n"," \n","If you're totally stuck feel free to ask your \"colleagues\" (fellow students), your instructor, or one of our junior instructors. Most of the time though, we'll have taught you the answer in one of the previous notebooks, please check back in them too. They will be a great source of information throughout this bootcamp.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd"],"metadata":{"id":"wHKoXnXoU7pm"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kZcFuXY19ZJd"},"source":["###### **Exercise 1:**\n","read the `vehicles.csv` dataframe and store it in a variable called `cars`:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UwV-Vx2d9ZJe","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1665133334573,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":1956,"user":{"displayName":"Sai Deshmukh","userId":"14179537551155636236"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"1bbf1d7f-987d-4587-dbd9-675aa0e621bd"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["                   Make                Model  Year  Engine Displacement  \\\n","0            AM General    DJ Po Vehicle 2WD  1984                  2.5   \n","1            AM General     FJ8c Post Office  1984                  4.2   \n","2            AM General  Post Office DJ5 2WD  1985                  2.5   \n","3            AM General  Post Office DJ8 2WD  1985                  4.2   \n","4      ASC Incorporated                  GNX  1987                  3.8   \n","...                 ...                  ...   ...                  ...   \n","35947             smart         fortwo coupe  2013                  1.0   \n","35948             smart         fortwo coupe  2014                  1.0   \n","35949             smart         fortwo coupe  2015                  1.0   \n","35950             smart         fortwo coupe  2016                  0.9   \n","35951             smart         fortwo coupe  2016                  0.9   \n","\n","       Cylinders     Transmission        Drivetrain  \\\n","0            4.0  Automatic 3-spd     2-Wheel Drive   \n","1            6.0  Automatic 3-spd     2-Wheel Drive   \n","2            4.0  Automatic 3-spd  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","3            6.0  Automatic 3-spd  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","4            6.0  Automatic 4-spd  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","...          ...              ...               ...   \n","35947        3.0        Auto(AM5)  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","35948        3.0        Auto(AM5)  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","35949        3.0        Auto(AM5)  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","35950        3.0        Auto(AM6)  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","35951        3.0     Manual 5-spd  Rear-Wheel Drive   \n","\n","                     Vehicle Class Fuel Type  Fuel Barrels/Year  City MPG  \\\n","0      Special Purpose Vehicle 2WD   Regular          19.388824        18   \n","1      Special Purpose Vehicle 2WD   Regular          25.354615        13   \n","2      Special Purpose Vehicle 2WD   Regular          20.600625        16   \n","3      Special Purpose Vehicle 2WD   Regular          25.354615        13   \n","4                     Midsize Cars   Premium          20.600625        14   \n","...                            ...       ...                ...       ...   \n","35947                  Two Seaters   Premium           9.155833        34   \n","35948                  Two Seaters   Premium           9.155833        34   \n","35949                  Two Seaters   Premium           9.155833        34   \n","35950                  Two Seaters   Premium           9.155833        34   \n","35951                  Two Seaters   Premium           9.417429        32   \n","\n","       Highway MPG  Combined MPG  CO2 Emission Grams/Mile  Fuel Cost/Year  \n","0               17            17               522.764706            1950  \n","1               13            13               683.615385            2550  \n","2               17            16               555.437500            2100  \n","3               13            13               683.615385            2550  \n","4               21            16               555.437500            2550  \n","...            ...           ...                      ...             ...  \n","35947           38            36               244.000000            1100  \n","35948           38            36               243.000000            1100  \n","35949           38            36               244.000000            1100  \n","35950           39            36               246.000000            1100  \n","35951           39            35               255.000000            1150  \n","\n","[35952 rows x 15 columns]\n"]}],"source":["# vehicles.csv 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zYGrzRhn_mz1HJLXxSO_MwR0_nWBS3K/view?usp=sharing'\n","\n","# your code here\n","#import pandas as pd\n","#path = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=%27+url.split(%27/%27)[-2]\n","#cars = pd.read_csv(path)\n","#cars = pd.read_csv('https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zYGrzRhn_mz1HJLXxSO_MwR0_nWBS3K/view?usp=sharing')\n","#print(cars)\n","\n","url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zYGrzRhn_mz1HJLXxSO_MwR0_nWBS3K/view?usp=sharing' #
